## Arts Map for First Peoples' Culture Council (2016)

**Project description:** An online map‐driven knowledge mobilization tool for the First Peoples’ Culture Council. The Arts Map shows public art and other related sites of interest. This map is open to contributions from Aboriginal artists and arts management professionals, as well as those who offer resources for those artists and organizations. The map is a living resource that grows as people contribute to it by entering themselves, organizations, events, sites of interest, or resources that support our arts.
