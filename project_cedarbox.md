**Project description:** Cedar Box is Python/GeoDjango application for (1) promoting Stewardship Office team collaboration and (2) managing consultation, heritage, fieldwork and GIS data â€“ all to support a First Nations cultural revitalization and economic development.

I started development of community information systems that grew into Cedar Apps in 2007. In 2018, Cedar was in use in over a dozen British Columbia Nations. You can find out more about Cedar features at [Mighty Oaks](https://mightyoaks.com/software-solutions/cedar-box).

Cedar is the only Indigenous community-based data management tool that fully integrates rich TUS/TEK data management with project proposals (Crown referrals) tracking and spatial analysis.
