## Cedar Box - First Nations Stewardship Tools

**Project description:** Cedar Box is Python/GeoDjango application for managing consultation, heritage, fieldwork and GIS data â€“ all to support First Nations cultural revitalization and economic development.

Cedar was the only Indigenous community-based data management tool that fully integrated (1) rich TUS/TEK data management, (2) project proposals (Crown referrals) tracking and spatial analysis, and (3) interactive community maps for schools and Band offices.

### History

Coding Cedar started in 2007 when Patrick Hayes and I built a consultation tracking tool built on top of Drupal CMS (Verion 5 and then quickly, 6). At the time it was called the 'Community Information Systems' (CIS). The first users were 2 First Nations near Prince Rupert BC and a Nation in the BC Northeast. By 2018, the system had gone through ~8 versions and 3 platforms, and was in use in over a dozen British Columbia Nations stewardship offices.
