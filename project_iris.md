## IRISBC Range Information Portal (2016)

**Project description:** In this 24 month project, led by domain expert Allen Dobb, I designed and developed a secure map-enabled portal for exploring and maintaining a rich range management knowledge base for BC Provincial government staff. The resulting community of practice site, has powerful browse and search capabilities covering the following topics: range science and technology, range administration, range legislation, range policy and range procedures. It has a dedicated Learning section, but the Portal itself is meant to be a open learning tool. The Portal includes some nice features like 2-way page references to show users what content mentions a particular Policy or Procedure; a rich media directory; and, of course, custom maps.

I also produced a 50-page Manual and a 1-page internal promotional poster to support communications and training.

**Portal highlights:** custom hierarchical menus; Quick links, Photo gallery; Notices with notification; Page maps; Hierarchical Site Map, Map Atlas, rich Media system; Learning modules with Video

**Technical details:** Drupal CMS, PostGIS database, custom modules; Manual and Poster produced using Adobe InDesign
