## Cedar Box - First Nations Stewardship Tools

**Project description:** Cedar Box is Python/GeoDjango application for managing consultation, heritage, fieldwork and GIS data – all to support First Nations cultural revitalization and economic development.

Cedar was the only Indigenous community-based data management tool that fully integrated (1) rich TUS/TEK data management, (2) project proposals (Crown referrals) tracking and spatial analysis, and (3) interactive community maps for schools and Band offices.

### History

Coding Cedar started in 2007 when Patrick Hayes and I built a consultation tracking tool built on top of Drupal CMS (Verion 5 and then quickly, 6). At the time it was called the 'Community Information Systems' (CIS). The first users were First Nations near Prince Rupert BC and in the BC Northeast. By 2018, the system had gone through ~8 versions and 3 platforms and Cedar was in use in over a dozen British Columbia Nations.
