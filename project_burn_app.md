## Burn App for Government of Manitoba (2017)

**Project description:** I created a mock up a new 5-step web application form with error checking and geocoding to retrieve parcel centroid latitude/longitude. The application system also has Google Captcha authentication (spam control) and email notifications for farmers and government delegates.

The second part of the system was the review tool, which allowed a Manitoba Government representative to review and issue/reject a permit application. The app has built-in links to weather forecasting for the area of the permit.

The last part of the system allows for printing of all outstanding permits, so that partners (law enforement) can obtain an up-to-date copy of where burning is authorized.
