  I am a results-orientated leader with experience in the planning, management and implementation of projects and programs to support organizational, operational and technological business transformation. I am an enabler of change with an open and collaborative leadership style and a proven ability to build, direct and manage cross-functional teams.

  Trained as a physical geography and landscape ecology researcher, I bring a holistic, systems approach to my work. I have a passion for supporting and leading communities and communities of practice. I lead evidence-informed, asset-based, and community-driven approaches.
