## UVic GEOG391 - Community Mapping (2010, 2016)

**Course description:** In this course we explored the theory and practice of community-based research and outreach methods that focus on mapping. The first aim of this course was to develop an understanding of the diverse theory of community mapping. The second aim was to gain a better understanding of a selection of practical community mapping tools for (1) collection, (2) processing, and (3) re-representation of mapped data. The third aim was to examine how community mapping may help us better understand human ecology and ecological sustainability. We will learn not only through assigned readings and class discussions, but also through working with community organizations in Victoria.

These were service-learning courses that provides an opportunity to apply theory to practice and gain hands-on research experience while also helping advance the goals of several Victoria non-profit organizations. Working with community partners, students gained valuable knowledge about community resources and needs, and helped identify and develop map-based outreach tools.
