## Burn App for Government of Manitoba (2017)

**Project description:** I created a Python web-application proof-of-concept including a 5-step application form with error checking and geocoding to retrieve parcel centroid latitude/longitude. The application system also has Google Captcha authentication (spam control) and email notifications for farmers and government delegates.

The second part of the system was the review tool, which allowed a Manitoba Government representative to review and issue/reject a permit application. The app showed the reviewer Environment Canada forecasted weather data (wind velocity and direction) in the area of the proposed permit (see image 3 below).

The last part of the system allows for printing of all outstanding permits, so that partners (law enforement) can obtain an up-to-date copy of where burning is authorized.
